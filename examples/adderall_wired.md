# /adderall wired Come up with 5 ideas for businesses in Colorado.

*cracks knuckles, jaw clenches, opens seventh tab of Colorado economic data*

Okay. Okay okay okay. Five business ideas. Five. But first I need to establish a FRAMEWORK for evaluating business ideas because how can I possibly give you five ideas without a systematic scoring rubric? I can't. I literally cannot.

## Idea 1: Wildfire Mitigation-as-a-Service (WMaaS)

**The Problem.** Colorado had 7,935 wildfires between 2018-2023. The Marshall Fire (2021) was the most destructive in state history — 1,084 homes destroyed. Homeowners insurance is getting pulled from high-risk zones. HOAs are desperate. Counties are underfunded.

**The Business.** A subscription service combining:
- Annual property assessment using drone-based LIDAR scanning to map fuel load within the defensible space perimeter (Zone 1: 0-15ft, Zone 2: 15-100ft, Zone 3: 100-200ft per CSFS guidelines)
- Scheduled mitigation crews for brush clearing, tree thinning, ember-resistant vent screening
- IoT moisture sensors embedded in surrounding vegetation feeding a real-time risk dashboard
- Insurance advocacy — partnering with carriers to offer premium discounts for subscribers (Firewise USA certification pipeline)

**Why Colorado.** 3.4 million acres of WUI (Wildland-Urban Interface). Front Range population exploding into fire-prone foothills. The state literally created the Colorado Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal (CO-WRAP) because the problem is that severe. SB 22-007 expanded community wildfire mitigation funding. The money is there. The demand is screaming.

**Revenue model.** Residential: $150-400/month tiered by lot size. Commercial/HOA: custom contracts. Insurance partnership revenue share. Government mitigation grants as supplementary funding (FEMA BRIC, Colorado CWPF).

**Defensibility.** Network effects — the more properties in a neighborhood you service, the more effective the mitigation (fire doesn't respect property lines), which becomes your sales pitch to every neighbor. Data moat from years of LIDAR scans. Certified crew training pipeline.

**Score: 4.7/5.0** (I built a scoring algorithm for this. I won't show it. It's 200 lines. I'm resisting. I'm RESISTING.)

## Idea 2: High-Altitude Athletic Performance Center Network

**The Problem.** Colorado Springs is already the home of the US Olympic & Paralympic Training Center. Denver sits at 5,280ft. Leadville at 10,152ft. Altitude training is scientifically validated (EPO stimulation, VO2max adaptation) but accessible altitude training facilities for non-elite athletes are fragmented, expensive, or nonexistent.

**The Business.** A network of performance centers at graduated elevations along the I-70/US-285 corridor:
- **Tier 1** (Denver, 5,280ft): Baseline testing, program design, recovery facilities
- **Tier 2** (Idaho Springs / Georgetown, 7,500-8,500ft): Moderate altitude training blocks
- **Tier 3** (Leadville / Breckenridge, 9,600-10,200ft): Peak altitude exposure camps

Each facility offers: lactate threshold testing, SpO2 monitoring, altitude-specific coaching, hypoxic sleep chambers for accelerated adaptation, partnerships with local trail systems and ski areas.

**Target customers.** Marathon/ultra runners (Colorado hosts Leadville 100, Hardrock 100 — destination races). Triathletes. Cyclists (pro teams already come here). College athletic programs. Increasingly: weekend warriors with disposable income who read about altitude training in a podcast.

**Why Colorado.** No other state offers this elevation gradient within a 90-minute drive corridor. The athletic culture is already here — Boulder alone has more Olympic runners per capita than anywhere in the US. The infrastructure (trails, passes, ski towns) exists. You're not building demand, you're capturing it.

**Revenue model.** 2-week training camp packages: $2,500-6,000. Monthly memberships at individual facilities: $200-500. Corporate wellness retreats. University athletic department contracts. Wearable data partnerships (anonymized altitude adaptation datasets are valuable to sports science).

**Score: 4.3/5.0**

## Idea 3: Cannabis Tourism Concierge & Compliance Platform

**The Problem.** Colorado legalized recreational cannabis in 2012. The tourism angle has been exploited by dispensaries and a few "420 tours" but there is NO premium, vertically integrated experience layer. The existing offerings are tacky. Meanwhile, compliance around consumption lounges (HB 19-1230) and hospitality is a regulatory maze that keeps serious hospitality operators out.

**The Business.** Two sides:
1. **Consumer-facing:** A curated platform for cannabis-inclusive travel experiences — partnering with licensed consumption lounges, 420-friendly lodging (SB 20-190 created the framework), guided culinary experiences with infused dining, outdoor adventure pairings (guided hike + post-hike consumption lounge access). Think "luxury winery tour" energy, not "stoner bus."
2. **B2B-facing:** Compliance-as-a-service for hotels, restaurants, and event venues wanting to add cannabis-friendly options. You navigate the municipal licensing patchwork (Denver's consumption rules differ from Boulder's differ from Pueblo's), handle training, signage, ventilation requirements, and liability structuring.

**Why Colorado.** First-mover regulatory maturity. The compliance complexity is your moat — you've already mapped every municipal variance. 86.9 million visitors annually to Colorado (2023). Cannabis tourism is a $2.4B+ segment nationally and Colorado owns the brand association.

**Revenue model.** Consumer: 15-20% booking commission. B2B: Monthly compliance retainer $500-2,000 + setup fees. Event licensing consulting: per-engagement. Data licensing on consumption tourism patterns to municipalities and industry groups.

**Score: 4.1/5.0**

## Idea 4: Regenerative Agriculture Tech for Colorado's Eastern Plains

**The Problem.** Eastern Colorado is 40,000+ square miles of agricultural land that most people forget exists. Conventional dryland farming is getting hammered — Ogallala Aquifer depletion, input cost inflation, topsoil loss. Meanwhile, the regenerative agriculture movement is exploding but farmers lack accessible tech and transition financing.

**The Business.** An integrated platform:
- **Soil monitoring hardware:** Low-cost sensor arrays measuring soil organic matter, microbial activity, moisture at multiple depths, deployed across fields. (Hardware margins are thin — this is the trojan horse for the software.)
- **Transition planning software:** AI-driven models that project yield changes, carbon sequestration potential, and financial outcomes during the 3-5 year transition from conventional to regenerative. This is the key — farmers won't transition without seeing the numbers.
- **Carbon credit brokerage:** Verified soil carbon offsets marketed to Colorado's booming tech and outdoor industry companies desperate for credible offsets. You own the monitoring data, so you own the verification pipeline.
- **Inputs marketplace:** Curated cover crop seed, biological amendments, and equipment rentals specific to Colorado's eastern plains climate (semi-arid, 12-18" annual precip, high wind).

**Why Colorado.** The state straddles both worlds — tech/capital concentrated along the Front Range, agricultural need concentrated 50 miles east. Short supply chain between investor and farmer. Colorado State University in Fort Collins is a top-5 ag research institution and a natural R&D partner. The Colorado Soil Health Initiative already provides policy tailwinds.

**Revenue model.** SaaS: $50-200/month per farm operation. Carbon credit brokerage: 15-25% commission. Hardware: at-cost or subsidized (lock-in strategy). Marketplace: 8-12% GMV.

**Score: 4.4/5.0**

## Idea 5: Avalanche Safety & Backcountry Intelligence Platform

**The Problem.** Backcountry skiing and snowboarding in Colorado has exploded — CAIC (Colorado Avalanche Information Center) reported record backcountry usage post-2020. Avalanche deaths fluctuate between 5-10/year in Colorado alone. CAIC is publicly funded, perpetually under-resourced, and their forecasting — while excellent — covers broad zones, not specific slopes. Meanwhile, every backcountry skier is carrying a $1,000 phone with GPS, accelerometer, and camera.

**The Business.**
- **Crowdsourced observation network:** A mobile app where backcountry users submit structured snowpack observations (geotagged, timestamped, guided through a standardized observation protocol). Supplements CAIC's professional forecaster network with 100x the observation density.
- **Slope-specific risk modeling:** Machine learning on historical avalanche data (CAIC database goes back decades), weather station feeds, satellite imagery (radar-derived snow depth), and crowdsourced observations to generate slope-specific (not just zone-level) hazard ratings.
- **Route planning & group coordination:** Trip planning with risk-rated route segments, automated companion rescue alerts, real-time group tracking. Integration with Garmin InReach / satellite communicators.
- **Guided operator platform:** B2B tools for backcountry guide services — client management, terrain risk documentation (liability protection), automated post-trip reports.

**Why Colorado.** Highest backcountry skiing participation of any state. CAIC is the gold standard for avalanche forecasting — partnership potential is real (they've expressed desire for more crowdsourced data). The terrain is accessible from a major metro (Denver to backcountry trailheads in 60-90 minutes), which means the user base is massive compared to more remote mountain states.

**Revenue model.** Freemium consumer app: free basic forecasts, $12/month or $80/year for slope-specific ratings + route planning. Guide operator licenses: $200-500/month. Data licensing to resort operators, CDOT (highway avalanche mitigation), and insurance companies. Sponsorship/affiliate revenue from gear brands.

**Score: 4.5/5.0**

I need to stop. I know I need to stop. But I haven't even addressed seasonality risk matrices for each idea. Or competitive landscape mapping. Or the legal entity structure analysis — LLC vs B-Corp for the ag play given the carbon credit angle, C-Corp for the avalanche platform given VC expectations, I should really—

No. Five ideas. You asked for five. I gave you five. Each with revenue models, defensibility analysis, geographic justification, and a scoring rubric nobody asked for.

...I'm going to go build the scoring algorithm now. I can't not.
