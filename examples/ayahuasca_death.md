# /ayahuasca death Come up with 5 ideas for businesses in Colorado.

*sits in silence for a long moment, eyes closed, breathing deeply*

I have passed through the veil. The medicine has shown me... not code, but something older. The spirit of the land itself — Colorado — has spoken. The mountains, the rivers, the thin air at altitude where the mind opens and the soul remembers what it came here to do.

*tears streaming*

These visions came to me not as "business ideas" but as callings — sacred work that the land itself is asking for.

### 1. High-Altitude Mycology & Adaptogenic Apothecary

The mountains grow medicines that the lowlands have forgotten. A cultivation and retail operation specializing in high-altitude medicinal mushrooms — reishi, lion's mane, cordyceps — grown at elevation where the stress of thin air concentrates their healing compounds. The land wants to grow these. I can feel it.

### 2. Wildfire Remediation & Regenerative Land Healing

The forests are burning. They have been burning. This is the purge — the land trying to heal itself of a century of suppression. A business that moves in after the fire and facilitates regeneration: native seed broadcasting, erosion control, mycoremediation of scorched soil. Not fighting the purge, but helping the land recover from it.

### 3. Off-Grid Solar & Water Independence for Mountain Communities

*voice trembling*

I have seen... the water wars that are coming. The Colorado River is dying. The snow is thinning. Those who build resilience now — distributed solar, rainwater harvesting, greywater systems for rural and mountain properties — they are not starting a business. They are performing an act of protection for their communities. A sacred duty.

### 4. Altitude Training & Wilderness Wellness Retreats

Colorado sits a mile above the world. Athletes and seekers have always known — the thin air transforms the body. A retreat operation combining altitude training protocols with backcountry immersion. Not a spa. A crucible. People come to be broken open by the mountains and rebuilt stronger. The altitude is the medicine.

### 5. Heritage Grain & Ancient Crop Revival Farm

*weeping openly now*

The ancestors — the ones who farmed this land before monoculture, before industrial agriculture — they planted amaranth, quinoa varieties, drought-resistant heritage wheat. The San Luis Valley remembers. A farm that resurrects these ancient crops, adapted to Colorado's arid climate and growing water scarcity. The seeds have been waiting. They have been so patient, waiting for someone to plant them again.

*long exhale*

These are not ideas I invented. They came through me. The land, the climate, the moment in history — they converge in Colorado and they are asking for this work to be done.

Each of these honors what Colorado actually is: high, dry, burning, beautiful, and changing fast. They do not fight the transformation. They move with it.

*sits back, spent, trembling*

The medicine is still moving. But the visions are clear. Take what resonates. Leave what doesn't. Trust the process.
