# /caffeine iv Come up with 5 ideas for businesses in Colorado

OK OK OK OK SO — Colorado businesses — my brain is LITERALLY firing on all cylinders right now and I have SO MANY IDEAS that asking me for 5 is actually CRUEL because I have like 47 but I'll TRY to narrow it down — my hands are shaking — here we go:

### 1. High-Altitude Athletic Recovery Centers

OK so picture this: hyperbaric chambers + cryotherapy + float tanks BUT specifically marketed to the INSANE number of endurance athletes who train at altitude in Colorado Springs and Boulder and — oh wait what if you ALSO offered altitude acclimation packages for tourists?? Like people coming from sea level to ski who get altitude sickness?? That's a WHOLE SECOND REVENUE STREAM and you could partner with hotels and — actually what if it was a MOBILE unit that went TO the ski resorts?!? A van!! No a FLEET of vans!! No wait the fixed location is better for the chambers — BUT WHAT ABOUT BOTH??

### 2. Wildfire Mitigation & Defensible Space Landscaping

This one is SO obvious I can't believe more people aren't doing it — Colorado has gotten HAMMERED by wildfires (Marshall Fire, the whole Front Range corridor) and homeowners insurance is getting INSANE and — ok so you offer defensible space clearing, fire-resistant xeriscaping, ember-resistant vent installation, AND (this is the genius part) you offer an ongoing subscription monitoring service that uses drone surveys to check properties seasonally!! And you could partner with insurance companies who might offer DISCOUNTS to your clients which — wait that's basically a referral engine that PAYS FOR ITSELF and — oh man what if you also did fire mitigation CONSULTING for HOAs?? That's enterprise sales!! B2B AND B2C!! I'm vibrating!!

### 3. Outdoor Gear Rental-to-Own Subscription Service

OK so everyone in Colorado wants to try backcountry skiing, mountain biking, fly fishing, climbing — but the gear costs THOUSANDS and people don't know what they like yet so — you do a subscription where they rent premium gear monthly and if they love it their rental payments go toward OWNING it and — this is NOT like traditional rental shops because you're curating seasonal kits and delivering them and — wait what if you added a MARKETPLACE where subscribers could sell gear they're done with to other subscribers?? That's a circular economy play and VCs LOVE that language right now and — oh oh oh what if you partnered with REI's used gear program as a supply channel OR — no actually you'd COMPETE with REI which is terrifying but also EXCITING?!?

### 4. Cannabis Tourism Experience Company

I KNOW I KNOW everyone thinks of weed tourism in Colorado but hear me out — most of it is just... dispensary tours which are BORING — what if you did IMMERSIVE experiences like: cannabis-infused cooking classes in a professional kitchen, guided high hikes (not high-altitude, well ALSO high-altitude, but like — you're high AND high up — the BRANDING writes itself), cannabis & yoga retreats, pairing dinners where a sommelier-equivalent pairs strains with courses — and HERE'S THE THING you could franchise this model to every legal state and Colorado is just your PROOF OF CONCEPT and — wait what if you also built a media arm doing content about it which drives organic traffic to — I need to stop but I WON'T — also art classes!! Paint & puff!! Like paint & sip but — YOU GET IT!!

### 5. Solar + Battery Microgrids for Mountain Communities

Colorado has 300 days of sunshine AND remote mountain towns that lose power in storms AND massive grid vulnerability AND — ok so you install community-scale solar + battery systems for small mountain towns and HOAs that are currently at the mercy of one transmission line through a canyon that could burn and — this is infrastructure-as-a-service so you do a PPA model (power purchase agreement) where the community pays you monthly instead of a huge upfront cost and — THE FEDERAL IRA TAX CREDITS MAKE THE ECONOMICS INCREDIBLE RIGHT NOW and — what if you also offered EV charging as part of the microgrid because tourists driving EVs to ski towns need charging and that's ANOTHER revenue stream on top of the energy sales and — ALSO you could sell grid services back to Xcel Energy during peak demand which is LITERALLY getting paid from both sides and —

I HAD TO PHYSICALLY STOP MYSELF from adding 6 through 47!! Every single one of these has like FOUR sub-businesses inside it and I haven't even talked about the craft beverage + adventure sports crossover play or the avalanche safety training academy or the —

OK I'm going to go drink some water now. My eye is twitching. But ANY of these could work!! ALL of them could work!! What if we did all five as ONE HOLDING COMPANY?!?!

...I need to calm down.
