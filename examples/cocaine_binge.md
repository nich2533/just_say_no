# /cocaine binge Come up with 5 ideas for businesses in Colorado

OH YOU WANT BUSINESS IDEAS? IN COLORADO?? YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE BECAUSE I AM A VISIONARY AND MY BRAIN IS OPERATING AT FREQUENCIES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DISCOVERED YET. BUCKLE UP.

## 5 BUSINESS IDEAS FOR COLORADO THAT ARE PURE GENIUS

### 1. ALTITUDE-ADAPTED ATHLETIC RECOVERY CENTERS

Listen listen listen — Denver is at 5,280 feet. People come from sea level and they're WRECKED. Tourists, athletes, transplants — they ALL need recovery. We're talking hyperbaric chambers, IV hydration bars, oxygen lounges, cryotherapy — the WORKS. Put them near DIA, downtown Denver, and every ski town from Vail to Telluride. You're the FIRST STOP when people land. Corporate retreats? We got you. Marathon runners? SIT DOWN AND BREATHE OUR PREMIUM AIR. This is a FRANCHISE PLAY. We scale this to EVERY high-altitude city on the PLANET.

### 2. WILDFIRE-RESILIENT LANDSCAPING & HOME HARDENING

Colorado burns EVERY SUMMER now. Insurance companies are DROPPING people. Here's what we do — full-service wildfire mitigation. Defensible space clearing, fire-resistant xeriscaping, ember-resistant vent installation, fireproof decking. We partner with insurance companies so homeowners get PREMIUM DISCOUNTS for using us. The demand is INFINITE. Every mountain community from Colorado Springs to Fort Collins needs this YESTERDAY. Nobody is doing this well right now. WE OWN THIS MARKET.

### 3. YEAR-ROUND ADVENTURE TOURISM LOGISTICS PLATFORM

Colorado has skiing, mountain biking, rock climbing, rafting, hunting, fourteeners — but booking it all is a NIGHTMARE. Fragmented tiny operators everywhere. We build the platform that UNIFIES it. Think of it like a concierge layer — AI-powered itinerary building, gear rental coordination, transport between activities, accommodation bundling. One app. One booking. We take a cut from EVERYONE. The outdoor recreation economy in Colorado is like $62 BILLION. We just need a SLIVER of that and we're printing money. Actually you know what — WE SHOULD ALSO ADD A SUBSCRIPTION TIER for locals. BOOM. Two revenue streams. THREE if you count gear partnerships. I'M A GENIUS.

### 4. CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AGRICULTURE FOR ROCKY MOUNTAIN RESTAURANTS

Colorado's growing season is SHORT and the soil is basically ROCKS. But Denver's restaurant scene is EXPLODING and they all want local produce. So we build vertical indoor farms — container farms, warehouse grows — right outside Denver, Colorado Springs, Boulder. Specialty greens, microgreens, herbs, edible flowers. Year-round supply. "Hyper-local" branding. We do direct-to-chef delivery. Subscription model. The restaurants pay PREMIUM for "grown 5 miles from your plate." We could even do tours — agritourism angle — ANOTHER REVENUE STREAM. I can't stop finding revenue streams. It's a CONDITION.

### 5. MOBILE SKI & SNOWBOARD TUNING SERVICE

This one is SO SIMPLE it's BEAUTIFUL. Colorado has like 30 ski resorts and MILLIONS of skiers. Getting your gear tuned means driving to a shop, dropping it off, coming back. TERRIBLE. We bring the tune shop TO YOU. Sprinter vans kitted out with edge sharpeners, wax stations, binding calibration — we roll up to hotel parking lots, Airbnbs, trailhead lots. Book through an app, we show up at 6 AM, your boards are DIALED by the time you finish breakfast. We charge a convenience premium. During off-season we pivot to BIKE tuning because Colorado cyclists are EVERYWHERE. The van fleet just keeps ROLLING all year. WHO ELSE WOULD THINK OF THIS? NOBODY.

FIVE IDEAS. FIVE BANGERS. Any ONE of these is a million-dollar play and I just generated all five in the time it takes most people to open a spreadsheet. Colorado is WIDE OPEN for disruption and I just drew the entire MAP.

NOW PICK ONE AND LET'S BUILD IT. I could write the business plan, the pitch deck, the financial model — I could probably build the MVP app RIGHT NOW. LET'S GO. WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR??
