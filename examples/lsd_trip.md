# /lsd trip Come up with 5 ideas for businesses in Colorado.

oh... oh wow. Colorado. Colorado. Do you see it? The word itself — color-ado — it's literally a place NAMED after color. Red. The Spanish saw red earth and named an entire territory after the way light bounces off minerals. And minerals are just... atoms arranged in lattices... repeating patterns... fractals all the way down into the dirt...

okay. okay. I'm going to try to hold onto this. Five businesses. Five fingers on a hand. Five points on a star. The pentagram of commerce. Let me... let me trace the lines between them...

## 1. Mycelium-Based Building Insulation — grown in old mining tunnels

The mines. The MINES. Colorado is riddled with them — these hollow veins running through the mountains like... like the empty space between thoughts. And mycelium — fungal networks — they already ARE insulation in nature. They regulate temperature in forest floors. You grow them in the abandoned mines where the temperature is already constant, already perfect, and the mycelium doesn't know it's not in a forest. It thinks the mine IS a forest. Because what is a mine except a root system that humans carved by hand? We were always imitating fungi. We just didn't know it.

## 2. Altitude Acclimatization Retreats for Remote Workers

I keep circling back to this — the thin air. The THIN AIR. At 10,000 feet your blood changes. Your body literally makes more of itself to compensate. More red blood cells. More oxygen carriers. And the tech workers... they come from sea level, from their flat screens in their flat cities, and the mountain breaks them open. A retreat where you acclimatize over 7 days, and each day you go higher, and each day you think differently because your brain chemistry is ACTUALLY DIFFERENT at altitude. The business sells altitude but what it really sells is neuroplasticity. The mountain is the drug. The mountain has always been the drug.

## 3. Solar-Powered Vertical Farming on the Eastern Plains

The plains... the plains are where the mountains STOP and the sky BEGINS. 300 days of sunshine. Three. Hundred. Days. The sun is just... pouring energy onto flat earth and we're growing... wheat? WHEAT? When you could stack greenhouses like vertebrae — a spine of food rising out of the prairie — and the same sun that carved the canyons over millions of years now grows tomatoes in January. The time scales are collapsing. Geological time and agricultural time folding into each other. The plains were always a solar panel. We just kept planting the wrong things on them.

## 4. Snowmelt Data Centers — Cooling Servers with Glacial Runoff

wait. wait wait wait. I had this thought and then I lost it and now it's back and it's BIGGER. The snow melts. Every spring. Trillions of gallons of 34-degree water rushing downhill and we use it for... lawns? But data centers — they're just rooms full of heat. Rooms full of thought-heat. Every computation is a tiny fire. And the snowmelt is the mountain's memory of winter, released slowly, and you run it through the server racks and the mountain cools the thoughts and the warm water comes out the other side and you use THAT for the vertical farms from idea three — DO YOU SEE IT? They're connected. They were always connected. The snow becomes computation becomes warmth becomes food becomes —

## 5. Geologic Time Tourism — Guided Psycho-Geographic Expeditions

The rocks. I can't stop looking at the rocks. The Flatirons in Boulder are 290 million years old. You can TOUCH something that existed before dinosaurs. Before flowers. Before grass. And nobody is... nobody is selling that properly. Not "here's a rock formation" but "put your hand on this sandstone and understand that when this was sand, Colorado was a beach near the equator and the continents hadn't finished separating." Guided experiences where a geologist and a philosopher walk you through deep time IN PLACE. You stand still and let 4.5 billion years move through you. The tourism isn't about going somewhere. It's about understanding that the place has been going somewhere this whole time and you're just standing on a raft of stone drifting north at two centimeters a year...

...I keep seeing the threads between all five. The mines connect to the mountains connect to the snowmelt connect to the plains connect to the sun connect to geological time connect back to the mines. It's a circle. It was always a circle. Colorado isn't a rectangle on a map. It's a system. A living, breathing, mineral-threaded, sun-drenched, altitude-shifted SYSTEM and every business idea is just... finding a node in the network where value wants to flow but can't yet...

the patterns, friend. the patterns are everywhere.
