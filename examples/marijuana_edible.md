# /marijuana edible Come up with 5 ideas for businesses in Colorado.

Oh... oh wow. Ok. Ok ok ok. Business ideas. Colorado. Yeah I can... I can definitely do that. Colorado is like... it's got mountains. And... yeah.

Wait hold on. Hold on hold on hold on.

What's in that `examples/` folder? It's untracked. It's just... sitting there. Untracked. Who put that there? Did you put that there? Why isn't it in `.gitignore`? What if... what if it's not supposed to be there? What if someone else put it there?

...

Ok sorry. Business ideas. Colorado. Right. I was doing that.

Have you ever really looked at the word "Colorado"? Color-ado. Like... it's got "color" right in it. That's... that's beautiful actually. The Spanish were onto something.

Ok so. Businesses. Five of them. In Colorado. Let me just...

Wait the README is modified too. `M README.md`. Modified by WHO? When did that happen? Was that us? ...was that me? Did I do that and forget? That's... that's unsettling actually. I don't... let's not think about that.

Ok HERE WE GO. Five business ideas. Colorado. For real this time:

1. **A hot spring shuttle service** that goes to all the hidden hot springs — because like... Glenwood Springs is cool but there's like a THOUSAND hot springs nobody knows about and people just want someone to drive them there because the roads are... the roads are a lot. You know? And you could sell snacks on the shuttle. Wait, is that two businesses? No it's one. The snacks are part of it. Bundled. Synergy.
2. **Altitude acclimation consulting for remote workers** — ok hear me out. Hear me out. People keep moving to Denver and Boulder for tech jobs and they can't BREATHE for like two weeks and they're useless. What if there was a service that like... helped them acclimate? Oxygen bars, training plans, the whole thing. Corporate contracts. "We'll get your new hires productive 40% faster." ...what percentage was I going to say? 40? Sure. 40.
3. **A... a... what was number three going to be.** I had it. It was right there. It was... oh! Wildfire home prep service. Because every summer now it's like the whole state is on fire and people need their defensible space cleared and their gutters cleaned and their... their vents covered with that mesh stuff. It's seasonal but so is skiing and skiing is like a whole economy so.
4. **Mobile ski/snowboard tuning van** — like a food truck but for waxing skis. You just pull up to the trailhead parking lot at Loveland or A-Basin and people bring their boards and you tune them right there. Fresh wax at 12,000 feet. ...do you think wax behaves differently at altitude? The boiling point would be... no wait that's water. Wax doesn't boil. Does wax boil? Everything boils eventually right? If you get it hot enough? That's... that's kind of terrifying actually.
5. **14er guided photography tours** — Colorado has like 58 fourteeners and everyone wants to bag them AND get sick photos for instagram and what if you combined a hiking guide with a professional photographer? Two birds one stone. One guide, one photographer, small groups, sunrise summits. You could charge... a lot. Rich people love mountains and content.

...

Wait did I do five? Let me count. Hot springs... altitude... fire... ski van... photos. Yeah. Five.

Wow I actually did it. That's... I'm proud of us right now.

...is the README still modified? That's still bothering me. I feel like we should check that. Or not. Maybe it's better not to know.

Does anyone else smell pizza or is that just me
