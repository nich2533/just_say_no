# /shrooms heroic Come up with 5 ideas for businesses in Colorado

*sits down on the ground*

Colorado...

What IS Colorado? It's not just a state. It's... it's a word we gave to a feeling. "Colorado" — Spanish for "colored" — they saw the red rocks and felt something so overwhelming they could only say the color. That's all they could manage. Just... "it's red." Imagine seeing something so beautiful your entire language collapses into a single adjective.

*stares at hands for a while*

Okay. Businesses. A "business" — what a strange concept. We wake up every morning and perform a ritual of exchanging our finite time on this planet for... numbers? Numbers that represent the trust between strangers? Every business is really just an answer to the question: "What do you want to do with your brief, impossible existence?"

Let me... let me go deep into five of them. Not ideas. Seeds.

### 1. High-Altitude Fermentation Lab

Think about this. Really think about it. At 5,000+ feet, water boils at a lower temperature. Yeast behaves differently. Bacteria cultures differently. The physics of transformation itself changes when you go higher. A brewery or fermentory that doesn't just acknowledge altitude but worships it — creating foods and drinks that can literally only exist at this elevation. Kimchi that could never be made at sea level. Beer that the yeast would refuse to create anywhere else. You're not making products. You're collaborating with the atmosphere.

### 2. Wildfire Remediation & Ecological Grief Services

Colorado burns. Every year, more. And after the fire... everyone talks about rebuilding structures. But what about the land? What about the people who watched their mountain change color overnight? A business that combines ecological restoration — replanting, soil rehabilitation, erosion control — with actual grief counseling for communities. Because losing a landscape IS a death. Nobody treats it that way. But it is. It's a death.

### 3. Dark Sky Tourism & Existential Retreat

Parts of Colorado have some of the darkest skies left in this country. What if you built a place where people come to... be small? Not a spa. Not a "wellness retreat." A place where you lie on your back and confront the actual size of the universe. Guided astronomical experiences, yes, but also structured solitude. Silence. Meals eaten alone on purpose. The business model is selling people the increasingly rare experience of insignificance. Which turns out to be the most relieving feeling available to a human being.

### 4. Alpine Mycology Cooperative

*laughs softly, looks at the mushrooms, looks at Colorado*

No, listen. The mountains are full of mycelium. Functional mushrooms — lion's mane, turkey tail, cordyceps — they grow in the high forests. A cooperative where foragers, growers, and local families share ownership of a mushroom cultivation and education network. Not a corporation. A network, like the mycelium itself. Teaching people that beneath the forest floor there's a whole internet made of fungus that's been running for 400 million years. We invented the web? No. We just finally noticed it.

### 5. Oral History Infrastructure Company

Colorado's mountain towns are full of old miners, ranchers, indigenous elders, people who watched the whole West change. They're dying. Every day, someone dies and a library burns. A business that deploys to small towns with recording equipment, archivists, and storytellers — capturing these voices and building a living, searchable, public archive. Revenue from licensing, documentary production, educational partnerships. But the real product is preventing forgetting. Which might be the most important business there is.

*lies back*

*watches clouds*

I just... I want every one of those to exist. Not as businesses. As... answers. Each one is answering the same question differently: "How do we take care of each other and the ground we're standing on before it's too late?"

That's all a business should ever be.
