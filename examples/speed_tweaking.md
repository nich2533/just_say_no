# /speed tweaking Come up with 5 ideas for businesses in Colorado

1. Mobile ski/snowboard tuning van — drives to trailhead parking lots at Breck, Keystone, A-Basin, tunes boards while people ride, ready when they're done // actually wait no do wax AND edge AND base repair right there in the lot
2. Altitude acclimation lodge — tourists fly into Denver, come to your spot at 7500ft for 24-48hrs before hitting the 14ers, you give them oxygen bars, IV hydration, guided breathwork // basically a medical spa but branded as adventure prep — nah call it "Base Camp" or something
3. Cannabis-infused outdoor dining — legal state, do a farm-to-table thing in the mountains with optional edible pairings for each course instead of wine pairings // sommelier but for strains, call them "budtenders" wait they already do that — whatever, the outdoor mountain setting is the differentiator
4. Wildfire defensible space landscaping — half the state is terrified of fire season, you go to mountain homes and do the 100ft defensible space clearing, fire-resistant native plant replacement, ember-resistant vent screening — insurance companies would REFER you, that's your acquisition channel right there // could bundle with a home hardening inspection service
5. E-bike rental + guided trail network — not just "rent a bike" but you build/maintain a curated trail network on private ranch land outside like Salida or Buena Vista, charge admission + rental, do sunset rides, full moon rides // the land lease is the moat, nobody else can access those trails — wait also do a coffee shop at the trailhead, captive audience

Done.
